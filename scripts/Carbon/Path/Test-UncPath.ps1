function Test-UncPath
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Tests if a path is a UNC path.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Converts the path to a URI and returns the value of its `IsUnc` property.

    This function does not test if path exists.  Use `Test-Path` for that.

    .EXAMPLE
    Test-UncPath -Path '\\computer\share'

    Returns `true` since `\\computer\share` is a UNC path.  Note that `Test-UncPath` does not have to exist.

    .EXAMPLE
    Test-UncPath -Path 'C:\Windows'

    Returns `false` since `C:\Windows` is not a UNC path.
