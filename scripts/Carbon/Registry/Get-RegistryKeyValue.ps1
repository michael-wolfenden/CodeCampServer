function Get-RegistryKeyValue
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Gets the value from a registry key.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    PowerShell's `Get-ItemProperty` cmdlet is a pain to use.  It doesn't actually return an object representing a registry key's value, but some other weird object that requires painful gyrations to get values from. This function returns just the value of a key.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    Get-RegistryKeyValue -Path 'hklm:\Software\Carbon\Test' -Name 'Title'
    
    Returns the value of the 'hklm:\Software\Carbon\Test' key's `Title` value.

        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]
        # The path to the registry key where the value should be set.  Will be created if it doesn't exist.
        $Path,
        
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]
        # The name of the value being set.
        $Name
    )
    
    if( -not (Test-RegistryKeyValue -Path $Path -Name $Name) )
    {
        return $null
    }
    
    $itemProperties = Get-ItemProperty -Path $Path -Name *
    return $itemProperties.$Name
}
