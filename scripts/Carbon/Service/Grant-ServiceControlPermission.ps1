function Grant-ServiceControlPermission

    .SYNOPSIS
    Grants a user/group permission to start/stop (i.e. use PowerShell's `*-Service` cmdlets) a service.

    .DESCRIPTION
    By default, only Administrators are allowed to control a service. You may notice that when running the `Stop-Service`, `Start-Service`, or `Restart-Service` cmdlets as a non-Administrator, you get permissions errors. That's because you need to correct permissions.  This function grants just the permissions needed to use PowerShell's `Stop-Service`, `Start-Service`, and `Restart-Service` cmdlets to control a service.
