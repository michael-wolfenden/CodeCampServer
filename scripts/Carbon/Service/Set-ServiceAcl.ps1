function Set-ServiceAcl

    .SYNOPSIS
    Sets a service's discretionary access control list (i.e. DACL).
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    The existing DACL is replaced with the new DACL.  No previous permissions are preserved.  That's your job.  You're warned!
    
    You probably want `Grant-ServicePermission` or `Revoke-ServicePermission` instead.

    .EXAMPLE
    Set-ServiceDacl -Name 'Hyperdrive' -Dacl $dacl
    
    Replaces the DACL on the `Hyperdrive` service.  Yikes!  Sounds like something the Empire would do, though.
