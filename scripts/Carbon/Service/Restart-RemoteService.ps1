function Restart-RemoteService

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Restarts a service on a remote machine.

    .DESCRIPTION
    One of the annoying features of PowerShell is that the `Stop-Service`, `Start-Service` and `Restart-Service` cmdlets don't have `ComputerName` parameters to start/stop/restart a service on a remote computer.  You have to use `Get-Service` to get the remote service:

        $service = Get-Service -Name DeathStar -ComputerName Yavin
        $service.Stop()
        $service.Start()

        # or (and no, you can't pipe the service directly to `Restart-Service`)
        Get-Service -Name DeathStar -ComputerName Yavin | 
            ForEach-Object { Restart-Service -InputObject $_ }
    
    This function does all this unnecessary work for you.

    You'll get an error if you attempt to restart a non-existent service.

    .EXAMPLE
    Restart-RemoteService -Name DeathStar -ComputerName Yavin

    Restarts the `DeathStar` service on Yavin.  If the DeathStar service doesn't exist, you'll get an error.
