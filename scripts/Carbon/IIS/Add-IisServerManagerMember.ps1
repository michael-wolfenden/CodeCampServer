    .SYNOPSIS
    INTERNAL. Adds a `ServerManager` property and `CommitChanges()` method to an object.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    This is an internal Carbon function for adding properties/methods to `Microsoft.Web.Administration` objects so that changes to them can be committed/saved.  It adds a `ServerManager` property, which is a reference to the `ServerManager` object which instantiated this object and a CommitChanges method, which calls down to the `ServerManager`'s `CommitChanges` method.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    $appPool | Add-IisServerManagerMember -ServerManager $manager -PassThru
    
    Adds a `ServerManager` property and `CommitChanges` method to `$appPool`.
