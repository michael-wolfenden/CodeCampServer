function Set-IisWebsiteSslCertificate
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Sets a website's SSL certificate.

    .DESCRIPTION
    SSL won't work on a website if an SSL certificate hasn't been bound to all the IP addresses it's listening on.  This function binds a certificate to all a website's IP addresses.  Make sure you call this method *after* you create a website's bindings.  Any previous SSL bindings on those IP addresses are deleted.

    .EXAMPLE
    Set-IisWebsiteSslCertificate -SiteName Peanuts -Thumbprint 'a909502dd82ae41433e6f83886b00d4277a32a7b' -ApplicationID $PeanutsAppID

    Binds the certificate whose thumbprint is `a909502dd82ae41433e6f83886b00d4277a32a7b` to the `Peanuts` website.  It's a good idea to re-use the same GUID for each distinct application.
