function Install-IisWebsite

    .SYNOPSIS
    Installs a website.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Installs a website named `Name`, serving files out of the file system from `PhysicalPath`.  If no app pool name is given (via the `AppPoolName` parameter), IIS will pick one for you, usually the `DefaultAppPool`.  If a site with name `Name` already exists, it is deleted, and a new site is created.

    By default, the site listens on all IP addresses on port 80.  Set custom bindings with the `Bindings` argument.  Multiple bindings are allowed.  Each binding must be in this format (in BNF):

        <PROTOCOL> '/' <IP_ADDRESS> ':' <PORT> ':' [ <HOSTNAME> ]

     * `PROTOCOL` is one of `http` or `https`.
     * `IP_ADDRESS` is a literal IP address, or `*` for all of the computer's IP addresses.  This function does not validate if `IPADDRESS` is actually in use on the computer.
     * `PORT` is the port to listen on.
     * `HOSTNAME` is the website's hostname, for name-based hosting.  If no hostname is being used, leave off the `HOSTNAME` part.

    Valid bindings are:

     * http/*:80:
     * https/10.2.3.4:443:
     * http/*:80:example.com

    .EXAMPLE
    Install-IisWebsite -Name 'Peanuts' -PhysicalPath C:\Peanuts.com

    Creates a website named `Peanuts` serving files out of the `C:\Peanuts.com` directory.  The website listens on all the computer's IP addresses on port 80.

    .EXAMPLE
    Install-IisWebsite -Name 'Peanuts' -PhysicalPath C:\Peanuts.com -Bindings 'http/*:80:peanuts.com:'

    Creates a website named `Peanuts` which uses name-based hosting to respond to all requests to any of the machine's IP addresses for the `peanuts.com` domain.

    .EXAMPLE
    Install-IisWebsite -Name 'Peanuts' -PhysicalPath C:\Peanuts.com -AppPoolName 'PeanutsAppPool'

    Creates a website named `Peanuts` that runs under the `PeanutsAppPool` app pool
