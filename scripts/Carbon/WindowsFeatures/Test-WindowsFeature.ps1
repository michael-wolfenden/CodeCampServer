function Test-WindowsFeature
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Tests if an optional Windows component exists and, optionally, if it is installed.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Feature names are different across different versions of Windows.  This function tests if a given feature exists.  You can also test if a feature is installed by setting the `Installed` switch.

    Feature names are case-sensitive and are different between different versions of Windows.  For a list, on Windows 2008, run `serveramanagercmd.exe -q`; on Windows 7, run `Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OptionalFeature | Select-Object Name`.  On Windows 8/2012, use `Get-WindowsFeature`.
