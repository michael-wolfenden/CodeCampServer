function Get-MsmqMessageQueuePath
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Gets the path to an MSMQ message queue.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The MSMQ APIs expect paths when identifying a queue.  This function converts a queue name into its path so that logic isn't spread across all your scripts.  

    Private queue paths are constructed differently.  If you need to get the path to a private MSMQ, use the `Private` switch.

    .OUTPUTS
    System.String.

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-MsmqMessageQueuePath -Name MovieQueue

    Returns the path to the `MovieQueue` queue.

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-MsmqMessageQueuePath -Name MovieQueue -Private

    Returns the path to the private `MovieQueue`.  Must be for the critics.  Early access for the win!
