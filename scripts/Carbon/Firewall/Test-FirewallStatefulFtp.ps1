function Test-FirewallStatefulFtp
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Tests if the firewall's `StatefulFtp` setting is enabled.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Returns `True` if the firewall's `StatefulFtp` setting is enabled, `False` otherwise.

    If the firewall isn't configurable, writes an error and returns nothing, which will probably be interpreted by your script as `False`.  Can't help you there.  At least you'll get an error message.

    .OUTPUTS
    System.Boolean.

    .LINK
    Assert-FirewallConfigurable

    .EXAMPLE
