function Uninstall-PerformanceCounterCategory
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Removes an entire performance counter category.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Removes, with extreme prejudice, the performance counter category `CategoryName`.  All its performance counters are also deleted.  If the performance counter category doesn't exist, nothing happens.  I hope you have good backups!  

    .EXAMPLE
    Uninstall-PerformanceCounterCategory -CategoryName 'ToyotaCamry'

    Removes the `ToyotaCamry` performance counter category and all its performance counters.  So sad!
